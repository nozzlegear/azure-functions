# Dart Playground

I wrote a post on the reasons I had decided *not* to use Dart in production (mainly due to how hard it is to use JSON effectively) at [https://nozzlegear.com/blog/quick-thoughts-on-the-dart-language](https://nozzlegear.com/blog/quick-thoughts-on-the-dart-language). I've managed to get JSON working relatively well using a forked version of the `dson` package and a build step (`dart tool/build.dart`), though it's still much more difficult than I want.
